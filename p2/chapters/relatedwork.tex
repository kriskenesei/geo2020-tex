\label{chap:rw}

Many relevant research papers have been located and examined as part of the literature review stage of this project. There are two main areas that are of interest in the context of this research, which follows from the research questions. The literature review concerning thes two areas will be presented below in two separate sections. Our proposed workflow was distilled mostly from what is described in this this section and is presented in the Methodology section.

\section*{Accuracy description of Lidar sensing and Lidar-based DEM-generation}

This review focused on Lidar-based elevation measurement. The reason for this is that we consider AHN our first priority in terms of elevation measurements, given the lack of information about the accuracy and exact acquisition methods relevant to DTB, as well as the relatively straightforward nature of extracting road elevations from it (as demonstrated by the commercial implementation). 

\section*{Accuracy description of Lidar sensing and Lidar-based DEM-generation}

Furthermore, our second area of interest is feature extraction because our intention is to not only systematically query the DEM for elevations around the NWB road centrelines, but to take into account only road points around them, with as best a level of completeness as possiblethe entire road surface as represented by the point cloud. This requires one to identify, or at least approximate the representation of the roadelevation points inside the point cloudroad. It is worth noting that our
