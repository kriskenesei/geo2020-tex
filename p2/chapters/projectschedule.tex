\section{Project Schedule}
\label{sec:pd}

The following page contains a diagram illustrating the schedule of my graduation year. Please note that the exact P3, P4 and P5 dates are not yet known, hence the week in which they are shown in the diagram are tentative. As a result, the overall length of time available in the second semester is also not yet fixed; the longest possible time is shown.
