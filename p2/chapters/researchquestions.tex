\chapter{Research questions}
\label{chap:rq}

The decision was made to include the research questions before the Related work section. The justification for this change is that in this particular research, the research questions primarily emerged from the requirements of the NDW assignment and the suspected shortcomings of the commercial implementation. The literature review was \textit{targeted} at identifying a range of methods that could be used to complete the 3D extrusion of NDW while ensuring and quantifying output accuracy and resolving the suspected issues with the commercial implementation. The research questions are presented as a range of primary questions along with secondary sub-questions.
