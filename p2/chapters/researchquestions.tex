\chapter{Research questions}
\label{chap:rq}

The decision was made to include the research questions before the Related work section. The justification for this change is that in this particular research, the research questions primarily emerged from the requirements of the NDW assignment and the suspected shortcomings of the commercial implementation. The literature review was \textit{targeted} at identifying a range of methods that could be used to complete the 3D enrichment of NDW while ensuring and quantifying output accuracy and resolving the suspected issues with the commercial implementation. The research questions are presented as a range of primary questions along with secondary sub-questions.


\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a combination of geomatics methods that can perform the elevation-enrichment of NWB. 
\item Examine by experimentation and analysis, how Dutch open data geospatial datasets can be used to enrich NWB with elevations in a manner that can conform with external spatial accuracy requirements.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Research and assess the initial accuracy of the input datasets. This includes NWB itself.
\item Track changes in accuracy throughout the procedure
\end{enumerate}
