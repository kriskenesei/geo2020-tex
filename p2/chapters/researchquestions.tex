\chapter{Research questions}
\label{chap:rq}

The decision was made to include the research questions before the Related work section. The justification for this change is that in this particular research, the research questions primarily emerged from the requirements of the NDW assignment and the suspected shortcomings of the commercial implementation. The literature review was \textit{targeted} at identifying a range of methods that could be used to complete the 3D enrichment of NDW while ensuring and quantifying output accuracy and resolving the suspected issues with the commercial implementation. The research questions are arranged into two main groups: practical questions relating to building a mainly 2.5D methodology to achieve the goals of NDW, and accuracy-related questions.


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is it possible to find a combination of geomatics methods that can perform the elevation-enrichment of NWB in a similar manner to the commercial implementation, but eliminating suspected shortcomings as best as possible?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Can this be done using the same (or equivalent) datasets as the ones used in the commercial implementation?
        \item 
        \item Is it possible to based the workflow entirely on 2.5D methods by decomposing this intrinsically 3D problem into a collection of smaller problems?
        \item Can such a method of decomposition be used to simultaneously solve the scaling issues related to handling a national Lidar point cloud input dataset?
        \item Is it possible to build a workflow that satisfies the above, but also allows efficient update operations to be carried out as new data arrives or old data is updated?
        \item How well does the implementation perform in areas of complex 3D road relationships? How can this performance best be assessed visually and quantitatively using real-world examples, such as multi-level motorway exchanges and roads on long, elevated civil engineering structures?
        \item How well does the implementation perform in areas where input elevation data is scarce, or missing? How can this performance best be assessed visually and quantitatively using real-world examples, such as dense vegetation cover or buildings occluding roads, roads in tunnels, or roads under other civil engineering structures?
        \item How can we best assess the overall performance of the implementation against the commercial implementation in key locations such as the above?
        \item Can the workflow be used to also derive elevations for lines representing the \textit{vicinity} of roads in the exact same way?
        \item Can the workflow be used to optimise the \textit{horizontal} location of NWB centrelines?
        \item Is the procedure useful in terms of providing a single "working environment" for multiple data providers? Can it serve as an aggregator of elevation information from various sources, including small scale ones (such as road management datasets)?
        \item The workflow is planned to produce surface models of road segment, but what would be needed to aggregate these into a global model containing all roads?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Can the workflow be developed in a way that it can guarantee prescribed levels of output accuracy?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What types of accuracy may we distinguish between? Topological accuracy? Lateral accuracy? Purely elevation accuracy? How does uncertainty of certain types of inaccuracy affect the output? What does it corrupt exactly?
        \item What is the accuracy of our elevation sources? Is it well-documented? In the absence of this in the documentation, can we estimate it some other way?
        \item Is the existing accuracy of NWB itself good enough to support such a workflow? What is the effect of NWB uncertainty (lateral uncertainty) on the output? Could the impact of this be reduced by optimising the lateral location of NWB?
        \tiem How does the accuracy of each of our input sources relate to one another, how are they suspected to interact when combined into a single dataset?
        \item What do we need to be able to track the evolution of the accuracy throughout the workflow? Can we build it exclusively from steps that prevent any serious degradation to the accuracy, while making the degradation quantifiable?
        \item Is the accuracy controlled by global factors only, or is it influenced by geographically local factors too? If so, how can we quantify these and include them in the output estimation of uncertainty? How can we minimise their effects?
        \item How does the addition of individual, small-scale sources influence accuracy locally? How can they be best made use of, possibly weighting options based on a comparison of input accuracy of available sources for a given region?
        \item Would it be possible to develop the solution in a way that it can indicate where levels of uncertainty drop below the threshold, and explanations of where the errors came from?
