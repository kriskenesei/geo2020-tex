# LaTeX repository of MSc research reports

**This LaTeX repository hosts my final source code and compiled PDF MSc thesis at the TU Delft, titled "Constructing a digital 3D road network for The Netherlands".** The software implementation is hosted in [my Python repository](https://github.com/kriskenesei/geo2020-modules).

The reports are all based on the LaTeX framework provided [here](https://github.com/tudelft3d/msc_geomatics_thesis_template), a copy of which is found in this repository under ´template_unchanged´.

The final thesis report is now available in the folder ´final_report´ with file name ´MScThesis_KristofKenesei_TUDelft.pdf´. The same folder containts the LaTeX source code of said report. No further modifications to the report are expected.

The original research proposal (P2 document) is found in the folder ´p2´. It is based on a modified version of the template that I adapted to comply better with the graduation manual's P2 requirements. The P2 and P3 presentations are also part of this repository.

The graduation regulations are found [here](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/rules/GraduationManualGeomatics2020-2021.pdf). 

This repo is linked to Overleaf using [this method](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_push_a_new_project_to_Overleaf_via_git%3F). I used Overleaf for most LaTeX editing tasks.

_Note:_ Following the release of my project proposal (P2), I have been informed that some of my statements about the accuracy of DTB (Section 4.3 of the report) are incorrect. Notably, while some of the dataset is indeed photogrammetry-derived, the road markings were derived from land-based Lidar surveying and tacheometry. As such, they are more accurate than I anticipated. The description of DTB in the thesis reflects this. The methods of the research were not affected by this.
