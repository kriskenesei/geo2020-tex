# TeX Repository of GEO2020 Reports

**This is the TeX repo containing all my P presentations and reports. Reports will all be built in the TeX framework provided [here](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/templates/). Presentations will not necessarily be built in TeX.**

The reports in this repo are all based on modified versions of the framework provided at the above link. The repo is linked to Overleaf, which I will use to for all LaTeX editing.

_More soon to come._
