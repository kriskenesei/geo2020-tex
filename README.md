# LaTeX Repository of GEO2020 Reports

**This LaTeX repo will contain all my P presentations and reports. Reports will all be built in the LaTeX framework provided [here](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/templates/), a copy of which is found here under ´template_unchanged´. Presentations will not necessarily be built in LaTeX.**

The reports in this repo will all be based on modified versions of the framework provided at the above link, via the empty template in ´template_empty´.

This repo is linked to Overleaf using [this method](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_push_a_new_project_to_Overleaf_via_git%3F). I will use Overleaf for most LaTeX editing tasks.
