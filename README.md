# TeX Repository of GEO2020 Reports

**This is the TeX repo containing all my P presentations and reports. Reports will all be built in the TeX framework provided [here](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/templates/). Presentations will not necessarily be built in TeX.**

The reports in this repo are all based on modified versions of the framework provided at the above link. The repo is linked to Overleaf using [this method](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_push_a_new_project_to_Overleaf_via_git%3F), which I will use to for all LaTeX editing.

_More soon to come._
