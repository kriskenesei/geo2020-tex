# LaTeX Repository of GEO2020 Reports

**This LaTeX repo contains all my P presentations and reports. Reports will all be built in (or based on) the LaTeX framework provided [here](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/templates/), a copy of which is found here under ´template_unchanged´. Presentations will not necessarily be built in LaTeX.**

The reports in this repo will all be based on modified versions of the framework provided at the above link, via the empty template in ´template_empty´.
Currently, the P2 report is found in the folder ´p2´. It is based on a modified version of the template that I adapted to comply better with the graduation manual's P2 requirements. The graduation manual is found [here](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/rules/GraduationManualGeomatics2020-2021.pdf).

This repo is linked to Overleaf using [this method](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_push_a_new_project_to_Overleaf_via_git%3F). I will use Overleaf for most LaTeX editing tasks.

_Important update:_ since the release of my project proposal (P2), I have been informed that some of my statements about the accuracy of DTB (Section 4.3 of the report) are incorrect.
Notably, while some of the dataset is indeed photogrammetry-derived, the road markings were derived from land-based Lidar surveying and tacheometry. As such, they are far more accurate than I anticipated.
The description of DTB in the final report will reflect this - I apologise for the mistake. The methods described in the proposal are likely to remain the same regardless, as the topological and completeness issues with DTB still remain.
